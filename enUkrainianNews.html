                    <p>"To plunge into the world of science, to learn interactively about natural phenomena and the laws of physics, to communicate with a robot - a Museum of Science has been opened for children in Lviv. The space contains about 100 interesting exhibits with which you can interact and thus learn new things about the world around you - water, air, optics, acoustics, electricity," wrote Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv Regional Education Authority, in his Telegram.
                    <p>The Museum of Science is located on 2200 square meters of space and is divided into thematic zones - sections of water, air, human, optics, science, acoustics, electricity, robots, and Formula 1 and VR.
                    <p>In addition, the facility has a laboratory, an acoustics zone with musical instruments, which looks like a recording studio. In the section with robots, you can have an interesting dialog with RoboThespian, who answers questions, performs tasks to sing a song or dance. There is also a KUKA robotic arm, which is used to assemble machines and other devices in industrial plants. </p>
